<h2><i>Goal</i></h2>

Geoscience Australia will reduce the cost of orginisational ICT by eliminating duplication and fragmentation and will lead by example in using cloud services to reduce costs, lift productivity and develop better services.

<h2><i>Australian Government definition of cloud computing</i></h2>

The Australian Government has adopted the US Governmentâ€™s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Definition of Cloud Computing . 

The following is an excerpt from the current NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, Special Publication 800-145 September 2011.
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.
